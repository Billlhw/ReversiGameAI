# ReversiGameSimpleAI
This AI's move is based on the number of tiles able to be flipped
The game allows for user input of the size of board and the colour they want the computer to play
The minimaxAI code uses minimax algorithm to iterate through the moves of the AI, the opponents, and the AI again to choose the best move possible. The value of each position is computed by a combination of mobility of pieces and the weight of the position of the pieces.
